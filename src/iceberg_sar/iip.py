"""International Ice Patrol (IIP) Iceberg Sightings Database (NSIDC G00807).

One row per sighting: position, UTC time, method, size class and source, per ice season
(Oct-Sep). Ends with the 2021 season. Useful sources off Newfoundland:
- aircraft / ship: METHOD `R/V` (radar + visual), `VIS`, `RAD`; SOURCE is a call sign.
- satellite: METHOD `SAT-HIGH` / `SAT-LOW` (analyst confidence). SOURCE `SN1A`/`SN1B` is
  Sentinel-1A/B; `SNL1` has Sentinel-1 pass times too (09:39 UTC descending).
Satellite sightings from the *same* Sentinel-1 pass are simultaneous with our scene, so they
need no drift correction (but come from the same sensor, so they are not independent).
