# Iceberg Alley SAR: Iceberg Detection off Newfoundland

## What this project is
Detect icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland & Labrador in Sentinel-1 SAR imagery with a CFAR detector, and display the results on an interactive **CesiumJS** globe with a timeline.

This is a portfolio project. It should show hands-on SAR and maritime-domain skills to remote sensing / ocean-tech employers in St. John's, NL. Clarity, reproducibility, and a polished demo matter more than state-of-the-art accuracy.

## About me (the developer)
- Geospatial engineer, 15+ years: photogrammetry (DEM, orthophoto, stereo), 3D reconstruction, geospatial AI.
- Strong in: Python (rasterio, Shapely, GeoPandas, FastAPI), PostGIS, PyTorch, CesiumJS, Vue, Docker, AWS.
- **New to SAR.** Explain SAR-specific concepts briefly when they come up (backscatter, speckle, polarization, incidence angle, CFAR, dB vs. linear). Don't explain general Python or GIS basics.
- I prefer small, hands-on steps that produce a visible result quickly over long setup phases.

## How to work with me (instructions for Claude Code)
- Work one milestone at a time. Before starting a milestone, confirm the plan in a few lines. After finishing, show how to run it and what to look at.
- Keep modules small and testable. Use type hints. Put parameters in `config.yaml` instead of hardcoding them.
- Never commit raw data, credentials, or model weights. Use `.env` for secrets and keep `data/` in `.gitignore`.
- Default CRS for outputs is EPSG:4326 (GeoJSON / CZML). For metric processing, use the scene's native projection or UTM 21N/22N (EPSG:32621 / 32622).
- When a choice has a well-known trade-off (e.g. CFAR variant, window sizes), pick a sensible default, say why in one line, and move on.

## Tech stack
- **Python 3.11+**: numpy, scipy, rasterio, shapely, geopandas, scikit-image, pyyaml, typer (CLI)
- **Data access**: `asf_search` (find scenes), `hyp3_sdk` (order RTC processing)
- **Viz**: CesiumJS (optionally in a small Vue app), CZML for time-dynamic detections
- **Optional**: FastAPI to serve results, Docker for reproducibility

## Data sources
1. **Sentinel-1 SAR imagery** via ASF Vertex (https://search.asf.alaska.edu). Requires a free NASA Earthdata login.
   - Product: GRD, processed with **HyP3 RTC** into analysis-ready GeoTIFFs (gamma0). Request **power (linear)** scale and convert to dB where needed. Note the HyP3 monthly processing credit limit.
   - **Check the polarization of each scene.** Depending on area and date, it may be IW (VV/VH) or EW (HH/HV). Prefer HH/HV: the CFAR and sea-ice mask are tuned on HV.
   - Fallback source: Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem.
2. **Area of interest**: "Iceberg Alley", the NE Newfoundland coast, roughly Bonavista to St. Anthony, extending offshore. Store the AOI as `aoi.geojson`.
3. **Season**: April–June has the most icebergs. Start with 2–3 scenes from one spring.
4. **Ground truth / validation**: Canadian Ice Service iceberg charts and the International Ice Patrol iceberg data for matching dates. These are for visual and approximate validation, not pixel-exact labels.
5. **Land mask**: OSM land polygons or GSHHG coastline, buffered ~500 m to remove coastal clutter.
6. **Point-level validation**: IIP Iceberg Sightings Database (NSIDC G00807, seasons up to 2021) and Sentinel-2 L2A optical targets (Earth Search COGs). Because IIP sightings end in 2021, per-berg validation uses spring 2019 scenes.
7. **Experimental classifier data**: Kaggle Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge chips (`data/kaggle/train.json`, don't redistribute).

## Current status (as of 2026-10-05)
- **Milestones 0–3: done.** Search, HyP3 RTC (10 m), land + pack-ice masks, CA-CFAR on HV with strip rejection and an HH co-pol check, GeoJSON detections, and the Vue + Cesium viewer.
- **Scenes:** spring 2025 (2025-05-02, 05-08, 05-14) in the viewer, checked against NAIS charts. Spring 2019 (2019-04-15, 04-29) and 2020-06-10 for point-level validation.
- **Validation (beyond the plan):** 78% recall (209/268) against same-pass IIP analyst labels on 2019-04-29, median offset 128 m. Precision is not measurable without AIS. Large bergs (>120 m) are missed. See `docs/validation-findings.md`.
- **Experimental:** iceberg vs. ship CNN trained on Kaggle chips (`iceberg_prob`). Use it as a review hint only; see the README.
- **Milestone 4: done.** Portfolio README with screenshots, `cli.py run` end to end for a date range (`pipeline.py`, scene selection in `run:` in `config.yaml`), and two LinkedIn post drafts in `docs/linkedin-posts.md` (local only, excluded via `.git/info/exclude`, never commit). Not done: Dockerfile, deployed static viewer.
- **Stretch not done:** OS-CFAR / K-distribution (`cfar.variant` has a slot for it).

## Milestones

### Milestone 0: Setup (short)
- Repo, virtual env, `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, `config.yaml`, `aoi.geojson`.
- **Done when:** `python -m iceberg_sar.cli --help` runs.

### Milestone 1: First image
- Search Sentinel-1 scenes over the AOI for a spring date range. Order one HyP3 RTC job, download it, and open it with rasterio.
- Apply the land mask. Save a quicklook PNG in dB with a sensible stretch.
- **Done when:** I can see a masked SAR scene of the NL coast and spot bright targets by eye.

### Milestone 2: CFAR detection
- Implement **CA-CFAR** (cell-averaging) on linear intensity: target cell, guard window, background window, threshold factor from a chosen false-alarm rate. Use a vectorized or convolution-based implementation for speed.
- Post-process: connected components, min/max size filter, remove edge and nodata artifacts.
- Output GeoJSON points with attributes: id, scene id, timestamp, lat/lon, area (px and m²), peak and mean backscatter (dB) per band, incidence angle.
- Compare visually against Canadian Ice Service charts for the same date.
- **Done when:** a GeoJSON of candidate targets overlays sensibly on the quicklook, with few obvious false alarms at sea.
- Stretch: try a K-distribution or OS-CFAR and compare.

### Milestone 3: Cesium viewer
- Export detections to CZML with time intervals per scene, so the Cesium timeline steps through dates.
- Style points by detection attributes (e.g. size by `structure_m`, color by contrast or distance to pack ice). Show the scene footprint. Info box shows attributes.
- Optional: SAR quicklook as an imagery layer (static PNG with bounds, or COG tiles via TiTiler).
- **Done when:** I can open the viewer, scrub the timeline, and click icebergs.

### Milestone 4: Polish for the portfolio
- README with a short write-up: problem, data, method, results, limitations, screenshots or GIF.
- Reproducible run: `cli.py run --config config.yaml` goes end to end for a given date range.
- Optional: Dockerfile, deployed static viewer, short blog or LinkedIn post.
- **Done when:** someone else can clone the repo, follow the README, and reproduce the demo.

## Known pitfalls to watch for
- Speckle and sea state: rough seas raise clutter and false alarms. Log wind conditions where possible.
- Coastline and islands produce bright returns, so the land mask buffer matters. OSM land polygons miss rocks/islets mapped as single nodes (thousands off NL); the land mask adds them from Overpass, and repeat detections at one spot are dropped as static targets.
- Near-range vs. far-range incidence angle changes backscatter. Keep incidence angle as an attribute of each detection.
- Sea ice (pack ice) looks very different from icebergs in open water. Early in the season, pack ice can cover parts of the AOI. Mask or exclude it rather than detecting it as icebergs.
- Keep dB vs. linear consistent: CFAR on linear intensity, dB for display and reported attributes.
- 10 m IW GRD is oversampled (~20 m true resolution). HV speckle grains span ~2×2 px and pass a 2 px minimum, so the HH co-pol check is needed.
- HyP3 removes the HV thermal noise floor, so open-water HV sits near −30 to −40 dB with ENL < 1. Estimate ENL from the scene instead of assuming it.
- Keep size parameters in metres in `config.yaml`. They are converted to pixels per scene, so tuning carries over between 20 m and 10 m.

## Decisions made
- First dates: spring 2025 (2025-05-02, 05-08, 05-14). Spring 2019 for IIP point validation, since that database ends in 2021.
- Viewer: Vue 3 + Vite + CesiumJS, Esri imagery basemap (no ion token needed).

## Open questions (decide with me as we go)
- Whether to add FastAPI + PostGIS for storing detections across many scenes, or keep flat files (flat files so far).
- Whether to keep the experimental classifier in the portfolio write-up, given that it can't be validated without AIS.


### Milestone 5: THOR foundation-model detector (comparison with CFAR)

Goal: run the THOR foundation model (frozen encoder + small trained head) on the
same HH/HV scenes as the CFAR, and compare both against the same IIP labels.
Reference: Forgaard et al., "Efficient iceberg detection in Sentinel-1 imagery
using the THOR foundation model" (IGARSS 2026). Weights: FM4CS/THOR-1.0-tiny and
-base on Hugging Face (Apache 2.0), loaded via TerraTorch.

New code lives in `src/iceberg_sar/thor/` (`encoder.py`, `chips.py`, `targets.py`,
`heads.py`, `train.py`, `infer.py`). Parameters go in a `thor:` block in `config.yaml`.

#### 5a: Smoke test (no training)
- Install TerraTorch + the THOR extension. Load THOR Tiny.
- Check the Sentinel-1 band list in the THOR code: are HH/HV supported, or only VV/VH?
  If only VV/VH: feed HH→VV slot, HV→VH slot, and note it as a known domain shift.
- Check what input THOR expects: sigma0, linear vs dB, and normalization stats.
- Run the frozen encoder on one 512×512 crop from 2025-05-08 at patch size 8×8.
  Reduce the embeddings to 3 PCA components and save them as an RGB PNG next to the dB quicklook.
- **Done when:** the PCA image shows bergs (and the ice edge) as visibly distinct
  from open water. If it doesn't, stop and reconsider before building anything.

#### 5b: Training data from IIP labels
- Select HH/HV IW scenes 2019–2021 that have same-pass IIP Sentinel-1 analyst labels.
  **Hold out all of April 2019** (covers the 2019-04-15 and 04-29 validation scenes
  and the same bergs on nearby dates). Split train/val by scene, never by crop.
- Order HyP3 RTC with **sigma0 radiometry** for these scenes (THOR was pretrained
  on sigma0). Budget against the monthly HyP3 credit limit before ordering.
- Extract 512×512 crops: crops around labelled bergs, plus negative crops sampled
  from open water, the pack-ice edge and coastal areas. Apply the land/ice masks as
  for the CFAR.
- Targets: apply the drift offset from `matching.py`, then render each sighting as
  a Gaussian on a heatmap (sigma in metres in config). Point labels, no masks.
- Save the chips under `data/thor/chips/`.
- **Done when:** I can see a contact sheet of ~20 crops with target Gaussians
  overlaid, and a summary table of crops/bergs per scene and per split.

#### 5c: Train the heads
- Precompute and cache frozen-encoder features for all chips (`data/thor/features/`).
  THOR Tiny at 8×8 on 512² is 64×64×192 per crop, a few MB each. After that,
  head training is fast and can be iterated on cheaply.
- Heads: (1) linear baseline, (2) CenterNet-style heatmap head (MLP + sigmoid,
  focal loss), which is the primary head because it matches point labels.
- Inference: sliding window with overlap over a full scene, peak extraction
  (3×3 max-pool NMS + threshold) → detections GeoJSON with the **same schema as
  the CFAR output**, plus `detector: "thor"` and `score`.
- **Done when:** validation loss curves are saved, and heatmap overlays on held-out
  validation crops look sensible.

#### 5d: Head-to-head with CFAR
- Run both detectors on 2019-04-15 and 2019-04-29 with identical masks, identical
  IIP labels and identical matching radius (`pointval.py`).
- Since precision isn't measurable without AIS, compare **recall at a matched
  number of detections**. Sweep the CFAR PFA and the THOR score threshold, and plot
  recall vs. detections per scene for both.
- Break down misses and detections by berg size (esp. >120 m, which the CFAR misses),
  distance to pack ice and incidence angle.
- Run THOR on the spring 2025 scenes and add it as a toggleable CZML layer in the viewer.
- Write up in `docs/thor-vs-cfar.md`.
- **Done when:** one figure (recall vs. detection count, both methods) and the
  write-up answer: where does THOR beat the CFAR, where doesn't it, and why.

#### Milestone 5 decisions
- Start with THOR Tiny at 8×8 patches. The paper reports Tiny ≈ Base, and 8×8 is close to
  4×4 at a quarter of the tokens. Try 4×4 only if small bergs are being missed.
- Encoder stays frozen. No fine-tuning of THOR itself.
- CenterNet head is primary, linear head is the sanity baseline.

#### Milestone 5 pitfalls
- Radiometry: gamma0 RTC ≠ sigma0. Use sigma0 products or convert with incidence angle.
- Leakage: the same berg appears across consecutive passes. Hold out by date range, not by scene.
- Tile borders: stitch overlapping windows and keep only centre regions, or peaks double-count.
- Compute: 5a/5b run on CPU. Feature caching and 4×4 inference need a GPU
  (e.g. an AWS spot g4dn/g5 instance). Don't commit weights or cached features.

#### Milestone 5 open questions
- If there are too few HH/HV scenes with IIP labels: add VV/VH crops to training
  (the paper's setup) and accept the cross-polarization shift?
- Whether a 4×4 run is worth the GPU cost after seeing the 8×8 results.
